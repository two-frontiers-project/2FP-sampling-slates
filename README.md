# Two Frontiers Project Sampling Slates

This repository collects the field sampling slates that the Two Frontiers Project uses while collecting samples. Each PDF distills the steps for a specific phase of the work so the team can reference the instructions on site.

The layouts follow the PADI® instructor slate system and are intended to be printed on waterproof plastic stock. Print them at 7.14″×4.8,″ punch a hole in the top left corner, and clip the sheets together with a ring or carabiner to take them into the field.
